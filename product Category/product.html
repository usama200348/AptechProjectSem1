            <p>Orchids are plants prized for their beautiful and unique flowers. Orchids make up one of the worldâ€™s largest plant families, with between 15,000 and 35,000 species, or types. Many people grow orchids as a hobby.

                Orchids grow in most parts of the world except for the areas near the North and South poles. Most orchids prefer warm, tropical areas. Orchids can grow in soil, completely underground, or on other plants or rocks. The species that grow on other plants or rocks do not have their roots in soil. Instead, their roots dangle in the air or cling to the plant or rock. They get moisture and nutrients from rainwater, rotting plant matter, or the air.
                
                Orchid plants can measure from less than an inch (2.5 centimeters) to more than 15 feet (4.6 meters) tall. There can be a single flower or clusters. The flowers can be as small as 0.1 inch (2.5 millimeters) or as large as 15 inches (38 centimeters) across. They can be almost any color, and some have spots or streaks. Many have a strong fragrance, or smell, but some have no fragrance at all.
                
                The flavoring known as vanilla comes from the seedpods of some orchid plants. It is used in baked goods and beverages, and it is an ingredient in perfumes as well.</p>

            <p>Fruit trees and grapevine are important horticultural crops, responsible for tens of billions of dollars per year to the global economy, and comprising a major source of income for growers and allied businesses worldwide. Losses from viroid infections in these crops are difficult to measure unless infected hosts are visibly damaged. Viroids may be latent in some hosts yet have adverse effects that often go unnoticed. Whether viroid-infected fruit trees or grapevine show obvious detrimental effects or do not induce noticeable disease, viroid infections are responsible for significant economic losses to these crops. Table 2.1 lists viroids of fruit trees and grapevine and their alternative hosts. Specific variants of three citrus viroids may induce beneficial effects on citrus trees. Most grapevine viroids are latent and distributed worldwide. Only grapevine yellow speckle viroid 1 (GYSVd-1) and grapevine yellow speckle viroid 2 (GYSVd-2) can induce a yellow speckle symptom on grapevine leaves (Koltunow et al., 1989), which varies in intensity and may be absent under certain weather conditions.</p>

            <p>If you haven't planted flowering shrubs in your backyard garden, you're missing out! While annuals and perennials are essential in your garden, shrubs add another layer of beauty to your outdoor space. Flowering shrubs also attract pollinators, provide screening, and brighten up the garden with colorful summer blooms. Best of all, they'll live for years, so they're a great long-term investment in your garden.

                Many new varieties of flowering shrubs have been bred to be more petite, so you can enjoy their colorful flowers even if you don't have a huge yard. The most important thing to remember is that you must choose a shrub that is suited to survive winters in your USDA Hardiness zone (check it using this USDA guide). Also, read the plant tag so you know what kind of light it needs. Full sun is considered six or more hours of direct sunlight per day, while part sun is about half that.
                
                When planting, make sure you dig a hole about twice the size of the container, then place your shrub in the hole at the same depth it was in the pot. Backfill the soil, tamp it down well to remove air pockets, and water it well. Keep the shrub wateredâ€”but not soaking wetâ€”for the first season because you want it to get well established. Give it a good soaking every few days (rather than a tiny amount of water every day) to help it establish deep roots.
                
                Ahead, find a few of our favorite flowering shrubs that work beautifully in any garden.</p>
